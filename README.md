# JackRabbit
light encryption for ham radio, in particular JS8call. primary goal is smallest possible payload.

üõ†Ô∏è Feature Overview
This application provides a GUI-based encryption and decryption tool using a Vigen√®re-like cipher and a customizable reference dictionary!

‚úÖ Dictionary Management

Loads a custom dictionary (database.txt) for encryption mappings.
it shorten the message a great deal! for example "telephone" is shortened to "A2"

‚úÖ Encryption & Decryption

Encryption:
Replaces words with mapped codes from the dictionary.
Encrypts using a Vigen√®re-like cipher over allowed characters (A-Z and 0-9).
Highlights words missing from the dictionary in the input text.
Decryption:
Converts ciphered text back to dictionary-defined words.

this simple program is tailor made for the shortest possible payload (for JS8call) but still offer a little bit of privacy.
not AES256 military grade like my other release, but just enought to prevent normal people from decoding it.
all words that are not found inside the dictionary are hightlighted in red for the user to see.

source code in the format of a .py is provided with a pre-made .exe for quick running.
the dictionary is already inside, but it is incomplete. more work is needed.

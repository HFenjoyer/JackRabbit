# JackRabbit
light encryption for ham radio, in particular JS8call. primary goal is smallest possible payload.

üõ†Ô∏è Feature Overview
This application provides a GUI-based encryption and decryption tool using a Vigen√®re-like cipher and a customizable reference dictionary!

basically this is using a dictionary reference table to replace words with simple 2-3 characters code. 
this make for a One Time Pad like encryption. it isnt FED proof, but plenty good for joking around.
without the dictionary it is impossible to crack. for example : A3 D2 H5
good luck trying to find what it means without my personnal look-up table.
this is the trick! not only does it provide pretty good protection, but i have formated the output to be suitable for Js8call (only UPPERCASE or numbers) 

my goal was first to make the payload text smallest possible.
no more 50characters to send "hello how are you"

JS8call and propagation can be pretty bad at receiving and its hell sending everything again and again until the other side has it correctly. now using this JACKRABBIT unique formating and reference table the text are not only shorter then normal, but it create pretty good security!



i dare you! encrypt something using this, and try to decode it sucessfully even while having the correct dictionary. when you dont know the message it is almost impossible to brute force, because you get words that are making sense. so how do you know if the guy is talking about going grocery shopping or installing a new railing on his boat? TRY IT

source code in the format of a .py is provided with a pre-made .exe for quick running.

i provide a special program to add words into the dictionary, and another to scamble the references codes.

=

some tips and tricks:

-when sending numbers =< 2characters, put some zeroes in front. this prevent mis-decode 
for example 23, write it as 023. for 2 write it as 002

-scramble your own dictionary!

-missing words? ADD THEM YOURSELF

-dont trust the .exe? compile it youself!
